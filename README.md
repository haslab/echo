# Echo

Echo if a bidirectional model transformation tool for the [QVT Relations](http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/1.1/) (QVT-R) transformation language, based on the [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu) model finder and built over the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
It can be used to check if instances of ECore models are consistent and, if not, update one of them to restore consistency. 

## Features

* Implements the checking semantics from the QVT-R standard;
* Implements the principle of least-change, returning all instances closest to the original;
* Support for both "enforce" and "checkonly" modes;
* Support for OCL constraints over the models.

For more information about how the tool is implemented please read the paper [Implementing QVT-R Bidirectional Model Transformations Using Alloy](http://www3.di.uminho.pt/~mac/Publications/fase13.pdf), recently accepted for publication at [FASE'13](http://www.etaps.org/2013/fase13).

## Installing

* Checkout the latest stable version (v0.1) from the git repository:
```
git clone git://github.com/haslab/echo.git
git tag
```
* Compile the java source files into an executable jar by running `make.sh`:
```
./make.sh
```
This will create the `echo.jar` file on the project root.

## Running

At the moment, Echo is available through an executable jar. The basic syntax is
```sh
java -jar echo.jar [mode] [qvt] [direction] [metamodel1] [instance1] [metamodel2] [instance2]
```
Direction should be "enforce" or "check". Metamodels should be presented in ECore, while instances should be xmi files conforming to the respective metamodels.
The user is able to choose the desired instance from those generated by the tool. 

## Examples

Folder [examples](examples) contains QVT-R implementations of some typical bidirectional transformations. Files `enforce.sh` and `check.sh` are examples of how to run the tool to perform consistency checking or enforcing.
