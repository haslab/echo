# Echo

Echo if a bidirectional model transformation tool for QVT Relations (QVT-R) transformation language, based on the Alloy model checker and built over the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
It can be used to check if instances of ECore models are consistent and, if not, update one of them to restore consistency. It has the following features:

* Implements the principle of least-change, returning all instances closest to the original;
* Support for both "enforce" and "checkonly" modes;
* Support for OCL constraints over the models.

## Running
At the moment, Echo is available through a command line executable. The basic synthax is
```sh
java Echo [mode] [qvt] [direction] [metamodel1] [instance1] [metamodel2] [instance2]
```
Direction should be "enforce" or "check". Metamodels should be presented in ECore, while instances should be xmi files conforming to the respective metamodels.
The user is able to choose the desired intance from those generated by the tool.
