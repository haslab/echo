# Echo

Echo if a bidirectional model transformation tool for QVT Relations (QVT-R) transformation language, based on the Alloy model finder and built over the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
It can be used to check if instances of ECore models are consistent and, if not, update one of them to restore consistency. It has the following features:

* Implements the principle of least-change, returning all instances closest to the original;
* Support for both "enforce" and "checkonly" modes;
* Support for OCL constraints over the models.

For more information about how the tool is implemented please read the paper [Implementing QVT-R Bidirectional Model Transformations Using Alloy](http://www3.di.uminho.pt/~mac/Publications/fase13.pdf), recently accepted for publication at [FASE'13](http://www.etaps.org/2013/fase13).

## Running

At the moment, Echo is available through an executable jar. The basic syntax is
```sh
java -jar echo.jar [mode] [qvt] [direction] [metamodel1] [instance1] [metamodel2] [instance2]
```
Direction should be "enforce" or "check". Metamodels should be presented in ECore, while instances should be xmi files conforming to the respective metamodels.
The user is able to choose the desired instance from those generated by the tool. 
Folder [examples](examples) contains QVT-R implementations of some typical bidirectional transformations and examples of how to run the tool to perform consistency checking or enforcing.
