# Echo

Echo if a bidirectional model transformation tool for the [QVT Relations](http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/1.1/) (QVT-R) transformation language, based on the [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu) model finder and built over the Eclipse Modeling Framework.
It can be used to check if instances of ECore models are consistent and, if not, update one of them to restore consistency. 

## Features

* Implements the checking semantics from the QVT-R standard;
* Implements the principle of least-change, returning all instances closest to the original;
* Support for both "enforce" and "checkonly" modes;
* Support for OCL constraints over the models.

Check mode verifies if two models are consistent according to the given QVT Relation.

Enforce mode updates the target instance to one of the closest consistent states. Echo presents all possible instances as Alloy models, which are translated back to xmi once the usar chooses the desired one. To measure the distance between instances, Alloy models are seen as graphs, and the graph edit distance is calculated (which counts node and edge deletions and creations).

For more information about how the tool is implemented please read the paper [Implementing QVT-R Bidirectional Model Transformations Using Alloy](http://www3.di.uminho.pt/~mac/Publications/fase13.pdf), recently accepted for publication at [FASE'13](http://www.etaps.org/2013/fase13).

## Installing

* Checkout the latest stable version (v0.1) from the git repository:

```
git clone git://github.com/haslab/echo.git
git checkout v0.1
```
* Compile the java source files into an executable jar by running `make.sh`:

```
./make.sh
```
This will create the `echo.jar` file in the project's root directory.

## Running

At the moment, Echo is available through an executable jar. The basic syntax is
```sh
java -jar echo.jar [mode] [qvt] [direction] [metamodel1] [instance1] [metamodel2] [instance2]
```
Direction should be "enforce" or "check". Metamodels should be presented in ECore, while instances should be xmi files conforming to the respective metamodels.
The user is able to choose the desired instance from those generated by the tool. 

## Examples

Folder [examples](examples) contains QVT-R implementations of some typical bidirectional transformations. Files `enforce` and `check` are example commands that perform consistency checks and enforcement executions, respectively.
