### UML2RDBMS
The [UML2RDBMS.qvtr](UML2RDBMS.qvtr) transformation is a simplified version of the classical object-relational mapping, between class diagrams and database schemes, used as a running example in the QVT standard.

#### Overview
Every persistent Class on the UML class diagram is matched to a Table in the relational database scheme, with a Column for every Attribute, including those inherited from super-classes. Associations between classes are mapped to foreign keys.

#### Meta-models
